MWA 32T UVFITS visibility writer.
--------------------------------

Author: Randall Wayth. Feb, 2008.

REQUIREMENTS:
cfitsio v3: installed in a location where the compiler/linker will see it.

CONTENTS:
SLALIB_C: 				SLA library. (not to be redistributed outside the MWA project)
uvifts.c uvfits.h: 		reader/writer of uvfits files
corr2uvfits.c: 			reads raw binary correlation files, reformats, calls uvfits writer
Makefile
header.txt: 			example file of key-value pairs with observational metadata
antenna_locations.txt: 	example file of antenna locations
instr_config.txt: 		example file of the instrument configuration

BUILDING:
make the program by typing "make". This will create a standalone program called "corr2uvfits".
type ./corr2uvfits
for a summary of command line arguments.

A quick EXAMPLE:
after correlation you have two files. e.g. simdat16.LACSPC (auto correlations) and simdat16.LCCSPC (cross correlations)

create/update your configuration files (see the top of the supplied example files for details) :
antenna_locations.txt
instr_config.txt
header.txt
You can call these config files whatever you like, but be sure to specify the file name on the command line if
you do not use the default names.

run it:
 # example: minimal command line args
./corr2uvfits -a simdat16.LACSPC -c simdat16_.LCCSPC -o simdat16.uvfits
 # example: turn on debugging. Specify a different header file.
./corr2uvfits -a simdat16.LACSPC -c simdat16_.LCCSPC -o simdat16.uvfits -H myheader.txt -d
