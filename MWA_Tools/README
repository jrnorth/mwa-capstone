                            copy-and-paste dependency install for Ubuntu 12.04

Quick Install:
$ git clone gitolite@git.mwa512t.org:MWA_Tools/
$ cd MWA_Tools
$ ./make_MWA_Tools.sh
$ python setup.py install
$ test_db.py #test db connection

Note!: The default database setup is for on site users.  To connect from off site, after python setup.py install, do
$ cd configs/
$ change_db.py curtin
$ cd ..

MWA_Tools provides:
    Connection to the observation list database to search for past observations or plan new ones.    
    A model of the MWA tile beam.
    Tools for planning observations with tile beams. Plot the beam on the sky!
    Source catalog (including recent observations).
    Catalog API for including catalog interactions and computing apparent fluxes.
    Stuff in MandC. Regular observers shouldn't need to install MandC! 
    See the MWA wiki for the latest updates!

        PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python2.6/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

    PostgreSQL set up:
        To use the psql database command-line client, set up the following environment variables in your .bashrc (or equiv)
        # NOTE: database usernames/passwords will be removed from hard-coded in the future. Please do this even if you don't
        # currently use the psql client.
        export PGHOST=ngas01.ivec.org   # change this for non-Curtin database
        export PGPASSWORD=<ask>         # change this as required for non-Curtin database
        export PGDATABASE=mwa
        export PGUSER=mwa
