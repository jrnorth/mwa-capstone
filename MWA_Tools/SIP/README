This pipeline contains:

mwapipe_uv.py
# This file contains the main code and logic to run the pipeline. Before running this code you must 
# open this file and set the path to the parset file. The parset file contains all the settings and paths
# to run the pipeline.

parset.txt
# This file contains all the parameters to run the pipeline

fits_utils.py
# Utils for combining fit images. 
 
X13_121_obslist.txt
# This file contains all the observations you want to reduce. Include the entire path and seperate observations 
# per line. Do not leave extra lines at the end of the file. 

> X13_delays.txt
# This file contains the delays (taken from the M&C database) for your observations. This is only used if you want
# to generate a primary beam corrected image. You will have to generate this file yourself (if not HydA). Include with the pipeline
# is an example of the X13 delays for Hyd A. Note, the pipline identifies the relevant delay(s) by the observation name.  

> mwapb.py
# Routines for generating the PB Maps.

##################################################################
# RUN THE CODE!
# Make a directory called UVFITS_Scratch and add it to parset.txt (first time only)
# Make a directory called results and add it to partset.txt (first time only)
# Once all the paths have been set in parset.txt; to run the pipeline within CASA type:
> execfile(mwapipe_uv.py)

#Dependencies: 

#The only depedency the pipeline requires is for pyfits to be installed within the 
#CASA enviroment.

# Do this by starting casapy and typing:

!which python

# the resulting path should point at CASA's python executable.

# Next, go get PyFITS. It lives at:
#
# http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits
#
# Go to "download" and get the latest release (the source).

# Untar it and change to the directory (for me pyfits-3.0.4). List and
# notice that you can see "setup.py" in there? That's your installer.

# Execute "setup.py" using the CASA python version, e.g.:

sudo /Applications/CASA.app/Contents/MacOS/python setup.py install

# The super-user command is needed to give it the permissions it
# needs (it did fail for me without this).

# Once this is done, you should be able to start casapy and then

import pyfits

# Check with "help pyfits" that this is the right version.

# If you want to see where it put things, I believe that's here:

/Applications/CASA.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/site-packages/

# You could have tracked this down from "help" on pyfits.

# It does require some other python modules but we assume that these are already installed (numpy etc).
