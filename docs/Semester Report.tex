\section{Executive Summary}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project description}
This semester, we produced a Web site that functions as a data browser for the MWA telescope's observations. It allows a user to log in with their account and select a date range using selectors at the top of the page and see a list of telescope observations that happened in that range (or scheduled observations that will happen, if the range extends into the future). Specifically, the user can see the observation ID (the unique identifier for the observation in the system), the observation name, and who scheduled the observation. Additionally, the user can see a graph that shows the status of the telescope's data pipeline over that date range. This graph shows the total observation hours scheduled for the telescope versus how many hours have actually been observed, and how many hours' worth of observation data have been transferred from the telescope to databases at MIT.
\subsection{Purpose of project}
The motivation for this project was to make improvements upon the existing site, which lacked some key features the MWA researchers really wanted. They wanted a site that would allow them to monitor the status of the telescope in real time, annotate and share data sets, create discussions about the data through forum-style discussions, and write custom queries that allow them to see the data they want, all on an intuitive Web platform. Ultimately, the goal for this project was to build a more dynamic, collaborative, and customizable site.
