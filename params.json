The website should allow users to view the status of the Murchison Widefield Array in Australia. We are to deliver a system that monitors data flow across the large, distributed radio telescope array and its backend data archive and provide an extensibility API for astronomers to write their own modules to use on the site.\r\n\r\nMeeting 2 Summary\r\n-----------------\r\nFriday, September 26th, 2014 at 1pm\r\nISTB4 692\r\nAttendees: Joseph North, Connor Alfheim, Ben Roos, David Ganey, Ryan Dougherty, Dylan Lusi, Dr. Judd Bowman, Dr. Danny Jacobs\r\n\r\n#### Summary ####\r\n+ Project sponsors discussed more detail regarding use-cases and user stories\r\n+ Specifically, we determined what features are 'must-haves' and identified some 'nice-to-haves'\r\n+ Also discussed specific implementation details (e.g. source code hosting, EC2 instances) and came up with a list of resources we'll need access to\r\n+ We discussed splitting up the team into multiple subteams to focus on different parts of the project\r\n\r\n#### Results and Action Items ####\r\n+ We will write up a requirements document in our own words to confirm we fully understand the sponsors' goals\r\n+ The sponsors will approve this when ready and work on the project can begin at that point\r\n+ Once we get access to the database, we'll need to clone a portion of it so we can get a better understanding of the types of data we'll be working with\r\n\r\nMeeting 1 Summary\r\n-----------------\r\nFriday, September 19, 2014 at 1pm\r\nISTB4 692\r\nAttendees: Joseph North, Connor Alfheim, Ben Roos, David Ganey, Ryan Dougherty, Dylan Lusi, Dr. Judd Bowman, Dr. Danny Jacobs\r\n\r\n#### Summary ####\r\n+ We were given a high-level overview of the research that Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Bowman are performing, and what needs this project fills with regard to it.\r\n+ We went over the basics of the project's physical (i.e., hardware) infrastructure, involving telescope arrays and multiple data centers in different parts of the world.\r\n+ Dr. Jacobs showed us the first two iterations of the project's Web site and pointed out what things he liked and didn't like about each, then led us through a mockup he made of what he'd like to see in the future.\r\n+ We determined that user stories would be helpful for figuring out the initial requirements and planned to make a template that we could work through with them to flesh out the basic workflow of the site.\r\n\r\n#### Results and Action Items ####\r\n+ We decided to have regular meetings at the same time and place on a weekly basis.\r\n+ We are to come up with a user story template that we can use at our next meeting to determine the project requirements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
