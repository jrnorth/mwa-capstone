<p>Name: Advanced Observing and Analysis Tools for Next Generation Radio Arrays</p>

<p>Sponsors: Dr. Judd Bowman and Dr. Danny Jacobs, School of Earth and Space Exploration, Low-Frequency Cosmology Group, ASU</p>

<p>Description: The low-frequency cosmology group would like improvements made to their web portal. The website should allow users to view the status of the Murchison Widefield Array in Australia. We are to deliver a system that monitors data flow across the large, distributed radio telescope array and its backend data archive and provide an extensibility API for astronomers to write their own modules to use on the site.</p>
